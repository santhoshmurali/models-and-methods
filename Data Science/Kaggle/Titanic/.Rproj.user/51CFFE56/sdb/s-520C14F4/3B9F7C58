    "contents" : "#Business Requirement of Titanic Project\n# The sinking of the RMS Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history.  On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the Titanic sank \n# after colliding with an iceberg, killing 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew. This sensational tragedy shocked the international community and \n# led to better safety regulations for ships.\n# \n# One of the reasons that the shipwreck led to such loss of life was that there were not enough lifeboats for the passengers and crew. Although \n# there was some element of luck involved in surviving the sinking, some groups of people were more likely to survive than others, such as women, \n# children, and the upper-class.\n# \n# In this challenge, we ask you to complete the analysis of what sorts of people were likely to survive. In particular, we ask you to apply the \n# tools of machine learning to predict which passengers survived the tragedy.\n\n# We will use CRISP-DM model for analysing this Data.\n# CRISP-DM Model stands for CRoss Industry Standard Process for Data Mining\n# It has 6 Steps\n# 1. Business Understanding\n# 2. Data understanding\n# 3. Data Preparation\n# 4. Modeling\n# 5. Evaluation\n# 6. Deployment\n\n## Business understanding\n#------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n#Basically we have to perform survival analysis using the data (variables) provided. We have to predict what sort of people were likely to survive during a ship wrtk\n#one more thing to consider is that, tnumber of variables provided is limited and we have to use only those. for example, weather is a key\n#factor for survival, which is not part of this data set, so we are ignoring it. Next we will try to understand the data.\ngetwd()\n\n\n## Data understanding \n# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n# I would like to put this as 2 step process.\n# 1.Metadata\n# 2.Exploratory Data analysis\n# Metadata\n# --------\n# There are 3 sets of files provided out of which 2 contains passenger data. 1 is for training and the other is for testing.\n# test.csv and train.csv both has same variables except 1 in train, Survived. \n# gender_submission.csv has only PassengerId and Survived indicator. We will use this file to compare our prediction accuracy.\ndata_test_titanic <- read.table(file = \"Data/test.csv\", header = TRUE, sep=\",\")\ndata_train_titanic <- read.table(file = \"Data/train.csv\", header = TRUE, sep=\",\")\n# Variable Description are as follows.\n\n# PassengerId\n# -----------\nstr(data_train_titanic$PassengerId)\n#   Integer vector and auto increment, nominal data.\n#   This will help us to uniquely identify the customer.\n\n# Survived\n# --------\nstr(data_train_titanic$Survived)\n#   Factor variable and Categorical data, \n#   1 : Survived\n#   0 : Not Survived\n#   This is the Y variable which we will be using for comparing againt. (We may choose to use C.A.R.T)\n\n# Pclass\n# --------\nstr(data_train_titanic$Pclass)\n#   This can be both categorical oe ordinal data. \n#   1 : Passenger belongs to First Class\n#   2 : Passenger Belongs to second Class\n#   3 : Passenger Belongs to Third Class\n#   If we see the description of the Class, it says 1st, 2nd and 3rd.There is an order of 1st, 2nd and 3rd. But it can also be considered as a 1st Category, 2nd Category and 3rdCategory.\n#   for conveniance purpose, we will consider this as only Nominal (Categorical) Data\n\n# Name\n# ----\nstr(data_train_titanic$Name)\n# This is a Character Vector and lists all the names of the passenger.\n\n# Sex\n# ----\nstr(data_train_titanic$Sex)\n# Sex is a Nominal Factor variable with 2 levels, 1 being male amd 2 being female\n\n# Age *********************************************\n# ----********************************************* Missing Value Treatment Needs to be performed\nstr(data_train_titanic$Age)\n# Age is a Number variable/Vector, it has several blank values (NA) in it.\n# There are 177 records with out Age. We have to perform Missing Value \n# We have to Address Treating the missing value during Data Preparation Step. \n\n# ---------------\n# SibSp &  Parch\n# ---------------\n# SibSp\nstr(data_train_titanic$SibSp)\n# Number of siblings / spouses aboard the Titanic\n# you see there is no distinction between Spouse and Sibling with the given data.\n# Both Siblings and Spouses are combined together.\n\n# Parch\nstr(data_train_titanic$Parch)\n# Number of parents / children aboard the Titanic\n# Here also, There is no distinction between Parent data and children data.\n# Both of them are clubed in same data set.\n#\n# SibSp - has Sibling and Spouse, is a pair\n# ParCh - has Parent and Children, is a pair aswell\n# If SibSp is > 0,which means the particular passenger has 1 or more sibling or Spouse in the ship\n# If Parch is > 0, then particular passenger has more than 1 parent or children in the ship\n#\n# SibSp       0\n# ParCh       0\n# Sibling     n\n# Spouse      n\n# Parent      n\n# Child(ren)  n\n#\n# SibSp       1\n# ParCh       0\n# Sibling     can be\n# Spouse      can be\n# Parent      n\n# Child(ren)  n\n# The Passenger can be travelling with a Sibling or Spouse\n# If she/he is travelling sibling, it does not mean that she/he does not have spouse, it means that she/he does not travel with spouse\n# If she/he is travelling spouse, it does not mean that she/he does not have sibling, it means that she/he does not travel with sibling\n# If Passenger is travelling with Sibling, mind that Passenger is also a sibling.
